Version: 0.1.5
Author: Travis Lin <travis[at]travaganza[dot]com[dot]au>



h2. Description

Qanda is an open-source Question and Answer platform written in PHP 5 and using Kohana MVC framework. It is built with simplicity in mind: lightweight, themable and each to extend.

Qanda is currently under alpha mode development, enthusiast developers are welcome to participate in this project.



h2. Design Goal

The aim for 1.0 release is to demostrate Q&A platform at its minimum: that is, the simpliest form.

Fundamental goal of Qanda 1.0 is to achieve the following:

* Ask Question
* Answer Question
* Comment on Question and Answer
* Accept Answer
* Vote on Question and Answer

Qanda is designed with forwarding thinking, features that are not part of fundamental are encouraged to be extended as application addons. That include theme switcher, social extensions like badges, follows and widgets like suggestions, tag clouds.
